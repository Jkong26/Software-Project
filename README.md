# Software-Project
This project was about designing and developing a Household Tariff Analysis App. This was a group project and my main responsibilities focused on conduct testing and quality assurance... where I designed and executed unit tests and performed statement and branch coverage testing which must achieve 100% coverage and pass rates.
